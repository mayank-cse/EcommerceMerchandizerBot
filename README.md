# EcommerceAdminBot

Bot Framework v4 core bot sample.

This bot has been created using [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com), it shows how to:

- Use [LUIS](https://www.luis.ai) to implement core AI capabilities
- Implement a multi-turn conversation using Dialogs
- Handle user interruptions for such things as `Help` or `Cancel`
- Prompt for and validate requests for information from the user

## Prerequisites

This sample **requires** prerequisites in order to run.

### Overview

This bot uses [LUIS](https://www.luis.ai), an AI based cognitive service, to implement language understanding.

### Install .NET Core CLI

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 3.1

  ```bash
  # determine dotnet version
  dotnet --version
  ```

- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- Install the latest version of the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) tool. Version 2.0.54 or higher.

### Create a LUIS Application to enable language understanding

The LUIS model for this example can be found under `CognitiveModels/FlightBooking.json` and the LUIS language model setup, training, and application configuration steps can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-howto-v4-luis?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=cs).

Once you created the LUIS model, update `appsettings.json` with your `LuisAppId`, `LuisAPIKey` and `LuisAPIHostName`.

```json
  "LuisAppId": "Your LUIS App Id",
  "LuisAPIKey": "Your LUIS Subscription key here",
  "LuisAPIHostName": "Your LUIS App region here (i.e: westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com)"
```
